# 👾 Hey, I’m Saleha ~  
---


🌱 **Currently exploring:**  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Machine Learning (with a bio spin!)  
- Assembly Language (x86)
- Computational Biology & Bioinformatics tools (BLAST, Reactome, UniProt, MEGA, etc.)  
- Web Dev as a side quest (think Streamlit dashboards, cool interfaces with HTML/CSS, and hints of JS)


🌚 **Academic Life:**  
I’m a 2nd-year Bioinformatics undergrad trying to make sense out of life through code, logic, and a lot of Stack Overflow.  
My projects usually sit at the intersection of biology, data, and design—from disease prediction models, sequence analysis pipelines, to even a cheeky movie recommendation system.


🧠 **What I'm aiming for this summer:**  
- Building a public portfolio (hello, GitHub!)
- Collaborating with like-minded peers  
- Lurking in academic workshops/ forums and pretending I understand protein folding algorithms
- Completing a few online courses


🛠️ **Languages & Tools:**  
Python | Java | C | MySQL  
Git | Reactome | UniProt | BLAST | EMBOSS | Jalview | Kalign | MEGA | Streamlit | LaTeX  


🤝 **Open to collaboration!**  
Whether it’s a quick hackathon, a slow-burn research pipeline, or a fun automation tool—I’m down to explore (as long as I’m leveling up)

🐼 **Fun fact:** I have 41 journals, and I *will* make bad puns.
