- 👾 Hiii, I'm Saleha ~
- 🌚 Primarily interested in graduating (send help) 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Data structures, Machine Learning, x86 Assembly language and of course, anything to do with Computational Biology. Web development is a side quest these days. 
- 👽 I take tangents regularly so I'm always open to collaborate on fun projects! (as long as I'm leveling up 👀) 
- 💃 Feel free to reach out to me on my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/saleha-asim-5b05aa244
- 🐼 Fun fact: I have 41 journals, and I *will* throw around bad puns.
